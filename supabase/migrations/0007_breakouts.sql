-- Breakout rooms: which attendee goes to which room, in which round.
--
-- A breakout is an ordinary agenda item (D76) — it already has a day, a time, a room and a
-- title. `slot` names the round ("Breakout 1") and groups the items that are alternatives to
-- one another; `code` is this room's value ("3A"), and is what the client's spreadsheet
-- column holds. An item with a null slot is an ordinary agenda item and behaves as before.
alter table agenda_items add column slot text;
alter table agenda_items add column code text;

-- Assignment is a real relation rather than a match against the imported spreadsheet value,
-- so a typo in the client's sheet ("3a ", "Room 3B") cannot read as "unassigned" with
-- nothing to catch it (D79).
--
-- `slot` is denormalised onto this row for one reason: `unique (attendee_id, slot)` is what
-- stops one person holding two rooms in the same round, and a unique index cannot reach
-- through agenda_item_id to the slot on the item (D80). Renaming an item's slot must update
-- its assignment rows.
